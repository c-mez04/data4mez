Bayesian on Crime

This project used bayesian inference along with Monty Carlo Markov Chains to test the effectiveness of the broken windows policing policy. The original dataset from the US Census Bureau contains crime rates by county. By separating the time period before and after the implementation of the policy we can recreate the populations they derived and compare the two populations. Using the difference of means we can see that there was not a drastic difference in the populations. Although the policy did have an effect it wasn't the major contributor to the fall in crime rates in NYC.
